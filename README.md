# Project: Android accounts authentication and SyncAdapter

####Started off with a [Basic android SyncAdapter Tutorial from the Developer Docs](https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/creating-sync-adapter.html)

The plan is the modify the above tutorial to do the following:

1. Write a user account & authentication
2. Fill in the content provider ?
3. Connect this Android App with a parse.com server to do some very basic syncing i.e. an array of integers
